# HadithBot

This twitter bot was created to make it easier for people on the platform to quote or cite Hadith during discussions, rather than having to post screenshots form a different site which can often be cumbersome and slow down the pace of discussion. This can be used to quickly cite and post the actual Hadith. The bot does this by scraping this information from Sunnah.com and then converting the information into a series of tweets which also includes a link at the end.

## Commands:
To call twitter bot into action you must structure your command into a tweet like this

 ```  @BotHadith Author Book Chapter ```
 
 here is an example
 
 ``` @BotHadith Bukhari 1 1```
 
 
 ### Link to the bot:
 
 https://twitter.com/BotHadith
